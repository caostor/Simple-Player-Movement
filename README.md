# A simple player movement written in C++ and SDL2
I created this project to learn a little more about SDL2 and share what I learned.

After creating this project, I learned a little about delta time and how important it is for a game. Basically the delta time is a float number that stores the response time of the program and with this you can multiply the delta time by a number and get a perfect movement.
